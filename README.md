This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This Project is hosted live, want to check it out? ðŸ‘‰ (https://nike-shoe-store-frontend-ten.vercel.app)

âš âš âš  PS: All the data in the project was stored on an online database with a free plan but the downside is all that data will get deleted after 3 months. So I prepared a video of the project when all the data is still present the link to that is below

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
